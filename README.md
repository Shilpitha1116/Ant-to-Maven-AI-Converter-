# Ant-to-Maven-AI-Converter


##Overview

This project focuses on automating the conversion of Apache ANT build configurations to Apache Maven using AI-driven techniques. Given the complexity of manually migrating legacy ANT-based builds to Maven, this tool leverages AI to analyze, interpret, and generate an equivalent Maven pom.xml file, reducing human effort and minimizing errors.

##Features

Automated ANT to MAVEN Conversion: Parses build.xml and generates a structured pom.xml file.

Dependency Resolution: Extracts dependencies from ANT tasks and maps them to Maven dependencies.

Plugin & Task Mapping: Identifies commonly used ANT tasks and suggests equivalent Maven plugins.

Build Optimization: Recommends best practices for Maven build configurations.

Error Handling & Logging: Provides detailed logs to help debug conversion issues.

AI-Powered Recommendations: Uses AI to enhance accuracy and suggest optimizations.

##How It Works

Input the ANT build file (build.xml) into the tool.

AI analyzes the structure and extracts relevant details such as dependencies, tasks, and targets.

The tool generates a Maven pom.xml, mapping dependencies, plugins, and configurations.

Suggestions & optimizations are provided to improve the Maven setup.

Manual review & refinement if necessary before final adoption.
